# Problem statement
I recently bought a XP-PEN Star G640 drawing tablet. 
On my Ubuntu 16.04 machine, the DIGImend drivers for non-Wacom drawing tablets do not work (they cause a black screen during boot). Luckily, even without installing any driver, the tablet almost works. The only problem is that the rocking button is not recognized correctly: Pressing the lower button leads to a middle mouse click (which is OK), but the upper button maps to a left click. This means it has the same behavior as "clicking" with the stylus itself.

The problem is that with this configuration you end up with basically one button. For really using the tablet, you need two: one for erasing and one for moving around. 


__TLDR__: G640 Tablet has one wrong keymapping on the upper rocking button: Left mouse click instead of right mouse click.
